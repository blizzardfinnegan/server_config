# Primary Server

The "primary" server denotes the server where the majority of the work will be done. This should ideally be the highest-spec'ed machine in the setup.

# Packages

|Package|Usage|
|---|---|
|`rsync`|File transfers; faster and safer than `scp`|
|`fish`| Preference; Shell that comes with autofills and reasonable defaults; ***NOT POSIX COMPLIANT***\*|
|`fwupd`| FirmWare Update Program and Daemon|
|`git`| Used for pulling down packages and config files|
|`links`| CLI-mode browser; May also be listed as `links2`|
|`neovim`| Derivative of Vim; text editor|
|`samba`| Server for SMB/Windows Network Drive protocol|
|`zfs`| File system protocol for accessing bulk storage|
|`apcupsd`|APC Uninterruptible Power Supply Daemon; for communicating with UPS|
|`docker`| Most services running on the server run in docker|
|`docker-compose`|Allows for docker configs to be stored in files|
|`openssh`|SSH backend|
|`openssl`|HTTPS library|
|`man-db`|Manual for installed software; Often called "man pages"|

*: "POSIX Compliance" is a standard for most shell programs, like `bash` and `sh`, which allow scripts to run largely regardless of which shell is installed. Some scripts and copy-paste commands expect POSIX compliance, so if/when scripts don't work in `fish`, `bash` is used instead.
